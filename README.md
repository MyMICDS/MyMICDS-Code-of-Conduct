# MyMICDS Code of Conduct

## Goal

This repository is aimed at establishing a code of conduct, team norms, and different roles for developers on MyMICDS.

## Scope

The [CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md](#) is adapted from the Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct. This is a generic open-source "Code of Conduct." In addition to this Contributor Covenant, other files are specific to the leadership and organization of MyMICDS.

The sets of rules outlined in this repository apply to all repositories under the MyMICDS organization whether under the MyMICDS GitHub organization or not. This also applies to any forms of communication about MyMICDS such as face-to-face conversation or under online communications like the MyMICDS Slack.

## Enforcement

This Code of Conduct is meant to be a general guide so the vision can stay aligned as passed down from student to student. Favor "the spirit of the law" compared to the "rule of the law" or what the words literally say. Members violating of this Code of Conduct should receive proper warning, and if problems continue, be dismissed from the development team.

## Revisions

This Code of Conduct is meant to be a set of rather static rules. Revisions should only be made via Pull Requests after the initial drafting stage (before and including commit hash [#XXXXXX](#)). **A Pull Request after the drafting period should be made for every change, no matter how small (Yes, even a typo!)** Pull Requests must then be reviewed and approved by designated leader [(see team roles)](#) and and at least a majority of active developers [(see team roles)](#).
